Speed Bump Card Game Project

This project is a web app card game based on a card game I know as speed bump. The objective is to guess if the next card is red or blue. If the player guesses right, they advance, otherwise, they move backwards. The goal is to advance seven times. The final three guesses need to be correct consecutively, as any wrong guesses after the 4th card return the player back to the 4th card rather than backwards just one spot. Detailed instructions for playing the game are in the web app, labeled 'instructions'.
